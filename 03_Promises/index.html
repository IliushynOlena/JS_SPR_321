    <h1>Working with Promises in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>An interface Promise(promise) is a wrapper for a value that is 
        unknown at the time the promise is created. It allows the results 
        of asynchronous operations to be treated as if they were 
        synchronous: instead of the final result of an 
        asynchronous method, a kind of promise (the literal 
        translation of the word "promise") is returned to obtain 
        the result at some point in the future.</p>
